# Social Network Analysis Assignments

This repository contains three folders, one for each of my social network analysis course assignments and a final project. The first assignment involved measuring the relation between distances of the nodes as a function of number of nodes. The second assignment involved measuring the asymptotic value of different network characteristics as the nodes reach infinite values in Girwan Newman network. The final project involved a whole social network analysis of Twitter activity in the event of killing of Mahsa Amini, a 21 year old Kurdish girl who was heavily injured when in prosecution of morality police. This event led to a massive protest afterward in Iran and all over the world.

## Folder Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

- `Assignment1`: This folder contains the files for the first assignment, which measured the relation between distances of the nodes as a function of number of nodes.

- `Assignment2`: This folder contains the files for the second assignment, which measured the asymptotic value of different network characteristics as the nodes reach infinite values in Girwan Newman network.

- `FinalProject`: This folder contains the files for the final project, which involved a whole social network analysis of Twitter activity in the event of Mahsa Amini's Death, Mahsa amini was a 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, also known as Jina Amini, died in a hospital in Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances.
